Technical record of engineering progress and systems study.

## Overview

I approach software engineering through the lens of constraints and trade-offs. My primary interest lies in the fundamental layers of computing—operating systems, memory management, and networking. This repository documents my study of these core principles and my efforts to build reliable, efficient systems.

## Technical Focus

*   **Systems & Backend**: Distributed architecture, concurrency models, low-level logic.
*   **Languages**: Go, Java, Python, C++, SQL.
*   **Problem Domains**: Backend infrastructure, API design, data structure efficiency.

## Repository Structure

*   **Implementations**: Functional builds of core components, such as load balancers and databases.
*   **Experiments**: Proof-of-concept code for testing specific technologies or hypotheses.
*   **Drills**: Algorithmic solutions and standard data structure implementations.

## Current Work

*   Studying distributed system consistency models.
*   Refining idiomatic Go patterns for production environments.
*   Optimizing database schema design and query performance.
