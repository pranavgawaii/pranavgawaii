# Pranav Gawaii

3rd-year Computer Science student. This repository serves as a work log for my engineering progress, tracking projects, experiments, and technical studies. I focus on backend systems, infrastructure, and solving lower-level problems.

## What I Work On

*   **Languages**: Go, Java, Python, C++, SQL.
*   **Domains**: Backend Systems, Distributed Architecture, API Design, System Internals.
*   **Focus**: Concurrency, Scalability, Memory Management, Data Structures.

## How I Build

*   **Projects First**: I learn by building. I start with a problem and research the solution as I go, rather than following guided tutorials.
*   **Fundamentals**: I value understanding the underlying mechanics—OS, networking, and memory—over mastering temporary frameworks.
*   **Iteration**: Code here is often iterative. I prioritize getting it working, then refactoring for structure and efficiency.

## What You’ll Find Here

*   **System Implementations**: Attempts at building components like load balancers, simple databases, or file systems.
*   **Backend Services**: REST and gRPC API implementations with a focus on clean architecture and testing.
*   **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Solutions and custom implementations to maintain strong problem-solving skills.
*   **Experimental Archives**: Proof-of-concept code and scratchpads for learning new technologies.

## Current Focus

*   Deepening understanding of distributed system patterns (consensus, replication).
*   Writing idiomatic, production-standard Go.
*   Optimizing database schema design and query performance.

## Contact / Notes

*   I am interested in discussing technical challenges and engineering collaboration.
