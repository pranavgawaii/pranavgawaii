Work log for engineering progress, technical studies, and systems experimentation.

## Overview

I approach Computer Science as a discipline of trade-offs and constraints. My focus is on understanding the fundamental layers of software—operating systems, networking, and memory management—before reaching for abstractions. This profile serves as a continuous record of that learning process, prioritizing clarity and function over aesthetics.

## Areas of Work

*   **Systems Engineering**: Distributed architecture, concurrency, and lower-level logic.
*   **Languages**: Go, Java, Python, C++, SQL.
*   **Problem Space**: Backend infrastructure, API design, data structure efficiency.

## Repository Philosophy

This space is not a showroom; it is a workshop. You will find:

*   **Implementations**: Functional attempts at building core components like load balancers and databases.
*   **Experiments**: Proof-of-concept code designed to test specific hypotheses or technologies.
*   **Drills**: Algorithmic solutions and data structure implementations.

## Current Focus

*   Studying distributed system consistency models.
*   Refining idiomatic Go and concurrency patterns.
*   Optimizing database query performance and schema design.
