> Building systems that think. Quietly.

I am an **AI Engineer & Full Stack Developer** focused on designing intelligent systems and scalable web infrastructure.

My approach is simple: **Craft over chaos.**
Code should be precise, expressive, and intentional. Like a late-night session where everything just flows.

## ⚡ The Rig

No bloat. Just the tools that get the job done.

| **Core** | **Intelligence** | **Infrastructure** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Python, JavaScript | PyTorch, TensorFlow | AWS, Docker |
| React, Next.js | OpenCV, LangChain | Kubernetes, MongoDB |

## 🕯️ Philosophy

I believe in software that feels human but performs like a machine.
- **Don't rush.** Speed is a byproduct of clarity.
- **Deep work.** The best code is written when the world is asleep.
- **Invent it.** The best way to predict the future is to build it yourself.

## 📬 Frequencies

I'm currently running in **Deep Work** mode but always open to signals from fellow builders.
